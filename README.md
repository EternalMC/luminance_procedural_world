# luminance_procedural_world
An experimental block sandbox world generator and viewer. Not a game (yet?)

This project uses https://github.com/phaazon/luminance-rs to abstract most OpenGL state and unsafety, but remains very low level.

Noise based world generation is coming.
This is in the very early stages, and I think I'll continue working on it, but I'm not sure.
